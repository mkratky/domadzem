The band Domácí Džem was born a few years ago from home jam sessions with our family and friends. The band's sound is colorful and rich, filling smaller venues with delightful tones — places like music bars, cafés, garden parties or even libraries and museums.

Our recipe:  

We take the finest international songs, add a little sugar, simmer, and pour them into decorative jars. The songs in the jars come in various flavors—rock, soul, or pop. Our recipe is purely homemade, with no added coloring or preservatives, so our music can't be stored for long—it’s meant to be enjoyed immediately upon opening!
